01  WS-AREA-1.         PIC X(100). 
01  WS-AREA-2.         PIC X(100). 
* In a COBOL program, if WS-AREA-1 and WS-AREA-2 are defined as above and you perform an operation like this: 
MOVE WS-AREA-1 TO WS-AREA-2
* It seems like a simple MOVE operation, but if WS-AREA-1 contains data exceeding the size defined by PIC X(100) ,it could lead to buffer overflow. 
* In case of any unexpected result or runtime issues, a careful check of data length against defined PIC clauses is critical.
*This error is likely to occur when the programmer forgets to account for the possibility of data exceeding the specified length.
